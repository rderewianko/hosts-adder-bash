# hosts-adder-bash

copy the script to /usr/bin or /bin as you wish, so that it will be easy to use it often

***Using the hosts adder shell script is quite easy :)*** :relaxed:

**Here is a demo**


***To add an entry***

> hostsctl -a 127.0.0.1 mysite.in

OR

> hostsctl --add 127.0.0.1 mysite.in

***To remove an entry***

> hostsctl -r mysite.in

OR 

> hostsctl --remove mysite.in

## For more info use help

> hostsctl --help  OR hostsctl -h


This is my first script and it is simple one.. :simple_smile:

Hope it will be useful for someguys out there :D
